# airships-cts-modding-docs

A more (WIP) up-to-date documentation for modding Airships: Conquer The Skies. 

The [current one](https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-module-kit/tutorials/acts-module-string-reference-guide) was last updated 4 years ago, and a lot has changed since.

Contributions are welcomed. If you feel something should be changed, don't be afraid to raise an issue about it, or fix it.
